# DCX Component library

## Commands

DCX Component Library scaffolds your new library inside `/src`, and also sets up a [Parcel-based](https://parceljs.org) playground for it inside `/example`.

The recommended workflow is to run DCX Component Library in one terminal:

```bash
npm start # or yarn start
```

This builds to `/dist` and runs the project in watch mode so any edits you save inside `src` causes a rebuild to `/dist`.

Then run either Storybook or the example playground:

### Storybook

Run inside another terminal:

```bash
yarn storybook
```

This loads the stories from `./stories`.

> NOTE: Stories should reference the components as if using the library, similar to the example playground. This means importing from the root project directory. This has been aliased in the tsconfig and the storybook webpack config as a helper.

### Example

Then run the example inside another:

```bash
cd example
npm i # or yarn to install dependencies
npm start # or yarn start
```

The default example imports and live reloads whatever is in `/dist`, so if you are seeing an out of date component, make sure DCX Component Library is running in watch mode like we recommend above. **No symlinking required**, we use [Parcel's aliasing](https://parceljs.org/module_resolution.html#aliases).

To do a one-off build, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

To run tests, use `npm test` or `yarn test`.

## Configuration

Code quality is set up for you with `prettier`, `husky`, and `lint-staged`. Adjust the respective fields in `package.json` accordingly.

### Jest

Jest tests are set up to run with `npm test` or `yarn test`.

### Bundle analysis

Calculates the real cost of your library using [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit) with `npm run size` and visulize it with `npm run analyze`.

#### Setup Files

This is the folder structure we set up for you:

```txt
/example
  index.html
  index.tsx       # test your component here in a demo app
  package.json
  tsconfig.json
/src
  index.tsx       # EDIT THIS
/test
  blah.test.tsx   # EDIT THIS
/stories
  Thing.stories.tsx # EDIT THIS
/.storybook
  main.js
  preview.js
.gitignore
package.json
README.md         # EDIT THIS
tsconfig.json
```

#### React Testing Library

We do not set up `react-testing-library` for you yet, we welcome contributions and documentation on this.

### Rollup

DCX Component Library uses [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) as a bundler and generates multiple rollup configs for various module formats and build settings. See [Optimizations](#optimizations) for details.

### TypeScript

`tsconfig.json` is set up to interpret `dom` and `esnext` types, as well as `react` for `jsx`. Adjust according to your needs.

## Continuous Integration

### Commit Messages

Commit message MUST be prefixed with one of the following depending on the content of the commit. See [what-is-commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint/#) for details.

```
[build, chore, ci, docs, feat, fix, perf, refactor, revert, style, test] [type-enum]

git commit -m "build: {{ name of build config change }}"
git commit -m "feat: {{ name of feature }}"
git commit -m "fix: {{ name of bug }}"
git commit -m "test: {{ name of test }}"
```

### GitHub Actions

Two actions are added by default:

- `main` which installs deps w/ cache, lints, tests, and builds on all pushes against a Node and OS matrix
- `size` which comments cost comparison of your library on every pull request using [size-limit](https://github.com/ai/size-limit)

## Module Formats

CJS, ESModules, and UMD module formats are supported.

The appropriate paths are configured in `package.json` and `dist/index.js` accordingly. Please report if any issues are found.
