# DCX React library

`dcx-react-library` is a react library with a set of components ready to use in your project.

There're plenty of libraries available in react that will help you to increase your productivity however most of them contain a lot of css and are really hard to style based on your project's requirements.

dcx-react-library is **UI/UX agnostic** so you need to provide styling for the look and feel of your preference.

To see the full list of components built in dcx-react-library, and how to use it, have a look on our [storybook-showcase](https://www.chromatic.com/library?appId=6069a6f47f4b9f002171f8e1) (Click on View Storybook to see the list of components)
Each component, described in storybook, will provide you 3 main sections:

- documentation: it will describe the list of properties available, optional and mandatory;
- live: you can play directly with all the properties and see how the component will behave;
- unstyled: the bare component without any style available;
- styled: an exaple (mainly based on GDS) of how to style the component and the final result.
