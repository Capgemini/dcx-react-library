# Label

A Label component ready to use in your form.  
Label is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.  
When you import the label component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following:

<Canvas of={LabelStories.Unstyled} />

A more complex example with all the possible properties is:

```js
<Label
  className="additional classes"
  value="text"
  id="user-defined-id"
  props={{ style: { color: red } }}
/>
```

Below a list of all the available properties:

<ArgTypes of={LabelStories} />
