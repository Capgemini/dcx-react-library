# DCX React library

[dcx-react-library](https://github.com/capgemini/dcx-react-library) is a React library with a set of components ready to use in your project.  
There are plenty of libraries available in React that can help to increase your productivity however most of them contain lots of css and are hard to style based on your project's requirements.  
dcx-react-library is **UI/UX agnostic**, this allows the dcx-react-library to be easily integrated into any project.  
You have few options to make your components good looking üíÑ:
1. You provide the styling to match the look and feel of your application passing the class to every component üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2. üî• üî• You use the design system tokens that we built for you (from version 1.0.0) üî• üî•

## Installation

To use dcx-react-library you need to type in your terminal:

```js
yarn add @capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library
```

## Usage

As soon the installation is completed you can use all the components built for you.

For example:

```js
import {Button} from '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library`;

function App() {
  return (
      <Button label="start" onClick={()=>{}}/>
  )
}
```

## Styling

We don't ship `dcx-react-library` with any included CSS. However, some stylesheet is required to use some components (for example, `toggle` and `tooltip`).

```js
/* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */
import '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library/dist/dcx-react-library.css';
```

## Design System

The `dcx-react-library` supports opt-in styling customizable via [CSS custom properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties).

To keep the library **UI/UX agnostic** the styles are not shipped by default. In order to include them in your project you can import them as follows:

```jsx
/* main.jsx */

import '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library/design-system/index.css'
```

Note that this will setup the styling for all the components in the library. You may want to fine-tune the imports if performance is critical for your application.

All the components have their own stylesheet and can be imported individually when needed:

```jsx
/* Needed for core styles */
import '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library/design-system/base.css'

/* Individual imports, works well with tree-shaking */
import '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library/design-system/form-control.css'
import '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library/design-system/button.css'
// ...
```

Don't forget to add the `base.css` import before loading the individual stylesheets. It contains the core definitions used for the design system to work.

### Customization

Loading the stylesheets will apply a neutral style resembling Material guidelines by default. There are 2 ways for further customizing the library:

* [CSS custom properties](#css-custom-properties)
* [Regular CSS styling](#regular-css-styling)

### CSS custom properties

This is the recommended way of customizing the library, you may think of it as the library's API, it provides a way of coherently styling all the related elements.

All custom properties follow the same pattern:

```
[scope]-[property]-[element]-[variant]-[state]
```

`scope`

Defines where the scope custom property will affect. Can be one of the following:

* border: box-model's border width, color, radius, etc.
* color: element's color, backgound color, etc.
* font: element's font family, size, line height, etc.
* spacing: box-model's padding

`property`

Defines the actual element's property that will be modified. Some examples are:

* text: element's font color
* background: box-model's background
* size: element's font size
* etc.

`element`

Defines the actual element that will be affected.

**There is a limited amount of elements**, there is not a 1 to 1 correlation with each available component.

The reasoning behind this is that even if we have different components they usually are styled together in a consistent maner. For example the checkbox, radio button and input all fall under the `forcontrol` element, they should have consistent colors, spacing, font sizes, etc.

These are the elements that support styling:

* action: interactive components that are triggered by the user (buttons, tabs, etc.)
* formcontrol: components that capture the user's input (checkbox, radio button, etc.)
* heading: all the layout headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
* body: layout's main content (p, span, code, etc.)
* link: components that can trigger a navigation (anchors, etc.)

`variant` (Optional)

Applies to components that support variants of the main element. For example an `Input` component can have a `floating` variant that animates the label when it receives user input.

`state` (Optional)

Applies to components that are stateful. For example a `Button` component can have a `hover` state. You can expect to find these definitions for interactive elements.

#### Defining custom properties

In order to consistently apply the styles across the application you may want to use the `:root` selector in your main stylesheet.

```css
/* main.css - your root CSS file */

:root {
  --dcx-color-text-action-default-primary: #212121;
}
```

The custom properties follow the same specifity rules as regular CSS. This means it is possible to overwrite the values for specific parts of the application or when conditions are met:

```css
body.dark-theme {
  --dcx-color-text-action-default-primary: orange;
}

.client-sidepanel {
  --dcx-color-text-action-default-primary: green;
}
```

#### Available custom properties

The following custom properties are available under the scopes:

<TokensList />

### Component's Design System

All components that support the Design System opt-in will display a `Design system` folder. Here you can find the Playground and predefined themes.

##### Inspecting the components

All components that support the design system will have the token definitions displayed under the debugger `styles` tab.

![Inspecting the design system](/design-system-inspect.png)

##### Playground

It is an interactive UI that displays the available custom properties for a given component.

To find the properties list use the `Toggle Available Tokens` button, then you can use the filter by scope and apply your own values for a quick preview.

##### Predefined themes

Right next to the `Playground` you will usually find themes like: `Dark`, `Material` and `Accessible`. You may want to have a look to get inspiration for your own token definition.

### Regular CSS styling

The Design System's purpose is to define the base styling of your UI, you can further fine tune the appearance by using custom CSS.

```css
.my-floating-button {
  width: 100%;
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 15px;
  right: 15px;
}
```

Your custom styles will overwrite the ones defined by the Design System when applied on specific elements:

```jsx
<Button className="my-floating-button">My Floating Button</Button>
```

**Make sure that your custom stylesheets are imported after the ones imported from `@capgeminiuk`** to avoid CSS specifity problems.
