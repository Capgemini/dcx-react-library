# DCX React library

[dcx-react-library](https://github.com/capgemini/dcx-react-library) is a React library with a set of components ready to use in your project.

There are plenty of libraries available in React that will help you to increase your productivity. 
However, most of them contain a lot of CSS and are really hard to style based on your project's requirements.

dcx-react-library is **UI/UX agnostic** so you need to provide styling for the look and feel of your preference.

## Installation

To use dcx-react-library you need to type in your terminal:

```js
yarn add @capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library
```

## Usage

As soon the installation is completed you can use all the components built for you.

For example:

```js
import {Button} from '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library`;

function App() {
  return (
      <Button label="start" onClick={()=>{}}/>
  )
}
```

## Styling

We don't ship `dcx-react-library` with any included CSS. However, some stylesheet is required to use some components (for example, `toggle` and `tooltip`).

```js
/* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */
import '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library/dist/dcx-react-library.css';
```
