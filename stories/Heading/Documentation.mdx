# Heading

A Heading component that renders HTML headers from levels 1 to 6
Heading is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.  
When you import the Heading component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following:

<Canvas of={HeadingStories.Unstyled} />

A more complex example with all the possible properties is:

```js
<Heading
    label="This is a Heading"
    level="1"
    className="title"
    id="user-defined-id" 
/>
```

Below a list of all the available properties:

<ArgTypes of={HeadingStories} />
