# Highlight

A Highlight component ready to use in your Typography.  
Highlight is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.  
When you import the Highlight component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following:  

<Canvas of={HighlightStories.Unstyled} />

A more complex example with all the possible properties is:

```js
<Highlight
  text="This is the content of the highlighted text."
  className="my-classname"
  props={{ id: 'my-highlight' }}
/>
```

Below a list of all the available properties:

<ArgTypes of={HighlightStories} />
