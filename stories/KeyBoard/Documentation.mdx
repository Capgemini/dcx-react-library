# KeyboardInput

KeyboardInput component ready to use in your application.  
KeyboardInput is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.  
When you import the KeyboardInput component without providing any className or associated style it will looks as following:

<Canvas of={KeyboardInputStories.Unstyled} />

A more complex example with all the possible properties is:

```js
<KeyboardInput
  className="additional classes"
  children="ctrl+p"
  id="user-defined-id"
  props={{ style: { color: red } }}
/>
```

Below a list of all the available properties:

<ArgTypes of={KeyboardInputStories} />
