# Card

A Card component ready to use in your projects.  
The Card component is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.
It allows you to set a 'layout' prop between vertical or horizontal, when provided it adds a className that you can use
to align the content in your card.
There is also the possibility to use the prop 'variant' based on the Card functionality.
Card is already setted up to receive the 'selected' prop if you need it.
When you import the Card component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following:

<Canvas of={CardStories.Unstyled} />

```js
<Card
  className="my-card-class"
  layout="horizontal"
  variant="interact"
  selected={true}
>
  <CardHeader className="my-card-header-class">Header</CardHeader>
  <CardImage
    src="https://placehold.co/100"
    alt="alt text describing the image"
  />
  <CardContent className="my-card-content-class">
    <p>Content text</p>
  </CardContent>
  <CardActions className="my-card-content-class">
    <button>Submit</button>
  </CardActions>
  <CardFooter>Footer</CardFooter>
</Card>
```
