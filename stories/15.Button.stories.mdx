# Button

A Button component ready to use in your form with support for delayClick and add an image before or after your label.

Button is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look
and feel you prefer.

### An example of 'un-styled' Button

<Canvas>
  <Story name="un-styled">
    <ButtonLive />
  </Story>
</Canvas>

<Props of={Button} />
