# `classNames` utility

A JavaScript utility created for joining multiple class names and conditional class names.

## Usage

The `classNames` function takes an array as its argument.
The array can contain elements with string or object types.
String in the case of simply joining multiple class names and object when there is a condition to which the class name should be applied.
If the value belonging to a given key is falsy, the key will not be included in the className.

### Joining multiple class names

```js
<div className={classNames(['first-class', 'second-class'])}></div> // ==> which becomes className="first-class second-class"
```

### Conditional class names

```js
<div
  className={classNames([
    'first-class',
    { 'second-class': condition, 'third-class': !condition },
  ])}
></div>
// => where if the condition is true, this becomes className="first-class second-class"
// => and if the condition is false, it class name becomes className="first-class third-class"
```

### Dynamic class names

```js
const messageType = 'error'

<div
  className={classNames([
    'first-class',
    { [`${messageType}-message`]: true },
  ])}
></div>
// => where this becomes className="first-class error-message"
```
