# `useHydrated` utility

This hook lets you detect if your component is already hydrated. This means the JS for the element loaded client-side and React is running.
useHydrated ensure the components are SSR(Server Side Rendering)-friendly, you can render different things on the server and client while ensuring the hydration will not have a mismatched HTML.

## Example

```js
  import { useHydrated } from '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library';

  export function Component() {
    let isHydrated = useHydrated();

    if (isHydrated) {
      return <ClientOnlyComponent />;
    }

    return <ServerFallback />;
  }
```

When doing SSR, the value of isHydrated will always be false. The first client-side render isHydrated will still be false, and then it will change to true.
After the first client-side render, future components rendered calling this hook will receive true as the value of isHydrated. This way, your server fallback UI will never be rendered on a route transition.
