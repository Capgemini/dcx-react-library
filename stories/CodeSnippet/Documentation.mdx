# CodeSnippet

A CodeSnippet component ready to use in your Typography.  
CodeSnippet is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.  
When you import the CodeSnippet component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following:  

<Canvas of={CodeSnippetStories.Unstyled} />

A more complex example with all the possible properties is:

```js
<CodeSnippet
  text="This is the content of the CodeSnippet."
  className="my-classname"
  props={{ id: 'my-code' }}
/>
```

Below a list of all the available properties:

<ArgTypes of={CodeSnippetStories} />
