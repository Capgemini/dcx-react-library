# Blockquote

A blockquote component ready to use in your Typography.  
Blockquote is UI/UX agnostic so you need to provide your style to have the look and feel you prefer.  
When you import the blockquote component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following:  

<Canvas of={BlockquoteStories.Unstyled} />

A more complex example with all the possible properties is:

```js
<Blockquote
  text="This is the content of the blockquote."
  footer="This is the footer of the blockquote."
  className="my-classname"
  props={{ id: 'my-blockquote' }}
/>
```

Below a list of all the available properties:

<ArgTypes of={BlockquoteStories} />
