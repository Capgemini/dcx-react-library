# Accordion

An Accordion component ready to use in your application.  
This Accordion component allows multiple sections to be open at the same time (multipleOpen), and uses a custom icon for the collapsed state (collapsedIcon). The expanded prop is an array that determines which sections are expanded by default.

Each AccordionItem represents a section in the accordion. It has a title prop that is used as the identifier for the section. The AccordionTitle and AccordionDetails components are used to define the content of the section title and details, respectively.

This documentation provides an overview of the Accordion component, how to use it, and the available properties.
In order to use the accordion component in your project, you should import all the following necessary components to use the Accordion in your project::

```js
  import { Accordion, AccordionDetails, AccordionItem, AccordionTitle } from '@capgeminiuk/dcx-react-library`;
```


When you import the Accordion component without providing any className or style associated will looks as following;

<Canvas of={AccordionStories.Unstyled} />
